# The Idea:

A brief exercise to aid understanding of how to use pickling
in python and what is going on under the hood.

# Useful things / questions etc:
- Made a nice little mini server client.
- Don't need to import the object on the client side. Everything about it 
is transmitted in the pickled data
	- How does this work? I guess it raises questions about how anything works at all
		in python, like for example what actually happens when you import a class
	- How similar to bytecode is the pickled data?
